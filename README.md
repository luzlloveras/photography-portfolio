# Photography Portfolio

This is a photography-first portfolio built to present travel and city work with simple navigation and a performance-minded layout. The focus is on clear galleries, fast image delivery, and a minimal interface that keeps the photographs in front.

## Status
Work in progress.
- Home, work index, and travel city routes are in place.
- Gallery list pages and photo detail pages are wired.
- Placeholder images are used to shape layout and pacing.

## Tech
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes
- Images use `next/image` with explicit `sizes` in gallery grids.
- Placeholder assets live in `public/work/`.
- Routes follow the App Router structure in `app/`.
